  In this tutorial we introduce a new trace named "Indicator". The purpose of "indicator" is to visualize a single value specified by the "value" attribute.
  Three distinct visual elements are available to represent that value: number, delta and gauge. Any combination of them can be specified via the "mode" attribute.
  Top-level attributes are:
    * value: the value to visualize
    * mode: which visual elements to draw
    * align: how to align number and delta (left, center, right)
    * domain: the extent of the figure

  Then we can configure the 3 different visual elements via their respective container:
    * number is simply a representation of the number in text. It has attributes:
    * valueformat: to format the number
    * prefix: a string before the number
    * suffix: a string after the number
    * font.(family|size): to control the font

   "delta" simply displays the difference between the value with respect to a reference. It has attributes:
    * reference: the number to compare the value with
    * relative: whether that difference is absolute or relative
    * valueformat: to format the delta
    * (increasing|decreasing).color: color to be used for positive or decreasing delta
    * (increasing|decreasing).symbol: symbol displayed on the left of the delta
    * font.(family|size): to control the font
    * position: position relative to `number` (either top, left, bottom, right)

    Finally, we can have a simple title for the indicator via `title` with 'text' attribute which is a string, and 'align' which can be set to left, center, and right.
    There are two gauge types: [angular](https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/) and [bullet](https://plot.ly/javascript/bullet-charts/). Here is a combination of both shapes (angular, bullet), and different modes (guage, delta, and value):

var data = [
  {type: "indicator", value: 200, delta: {reference: 160},
   gauge: {axis: {visible: false, range: [0, 200]}}, domain: {row: 0, column: 0}},
  {type: "indicator", value: 120, gauge: {shape: "bullet", axis: {visible: false,
   range: [-200, 200]}}, domain: {x: [0.05, 0.5], y: [0.15, 0.35]}},
  {type: "indicator", mode: "number+delta", value: 300, domain: {row: 0, column: 1}},
  {type: "indicator", mode: "delta", value: 40, domain: {row: 1, column: 1}}];

var layout = {width: 600, height: 400, margin: {t: 25, b: 25, l: 25, r: 25},
    grid: {rows: 2, columns: 2, pattern: "independent"}, template: {
    data: {indicator: [{title: {text: "Speed"}, mode: "number+delta+gauge",
    delta: {reference: 90}}]}}};
