### New to Plotly?

Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
[Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

### Version Check

Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>
Check out [this post](http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/) for more information on breaking changes and new features available in this version.

```{r}
library(plotly)
packageVersion('plotly')
```

### Supported Formats For Static Image Export

With the `plotly` R package, you can export your charts as static images in the `.png` and `.jpg/.jpeg` file formats.

Currently, exporting charts as static images in the `.eps`, `.svg`, and `.pdf` formats is a feature that is available only to users of [Chart Studio Enterprise](https://plot.ly/online-chart-maker/).

**Note:** It is important to be aware that any R charts containing WebGL-based traces (i.e. of type `scattergl`, `heatmapgl`, `contourgl`, `scatter3d`, `surface`, `mesh3d`, `scatterpolargl`, `cone`, `streamtube`, `splom`, or `parcoords`) that are exported in a vector format like `.eps`, `.svg`, and `.pdf` will include encapsulated rasters instead of vectors for some parts of the image.

### Supported Methods Static Image Export

To export R charts as static images with the `plotly` R package, you can:

* use the built-in integration with [Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca), Plotly's command line application for generating static images.

* export the image using your Chart Studio account using the `plotly_IMAGE()` fucntion.

* append the format extension to the plot url of an existing Chart Studio plot. For example, the `.jpg` version of the plot at https://plot.ly/~chris/1638 is available at https://plot.ly/~chris/1638.jpg. The `.png` version of the plot is available at https://plot.ly/~chris/1638.png.

#### Using Orca To Export Static Images Locally

Version `4.7.900` and above of the `plotly` R package include the `orca()` function (replacing the `export()` function). 

This function exports images locally using [Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca). In order to use Orca with the `plotly` R package, you need to install the [`processx`](https://github.com/r-lib/processx) package as well.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("processx")) install.packages("processx")

p <- plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>% add_surface()

orca(p, "surface-plot.svg")
```

#### Using Chart Studio to Export Static Images

Another option for exporting the R charts you create with the `plotly` R package is to use your Chart Studio account.

This requires using the development version of the `plotly` R package from GitHub. This can be installed using the [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) R package.

```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
```
 
In addition, if you haven't already, let the R session know about your Chart Studio authorization credentials by setting environment variables using [`Sys.setenv()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/Sys.setenv).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv("plotly_username" = "YOUR USER NAME")
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key" = "YOUR API KEY")
```

The `plotly_IMAGE()` function exports plots as static images using the Chart Studio web service. The image will be stored in a file in the working directory of your R session.

```{r}
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(x = c(1,2,3,4), y = c(2,4,1,3), type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')
plotly_IMAGE(p, format = "png", out_file = "output.png")
```

#### Appending Static Image File Types to Chart Studio Plot URLs

You can also view the static image version of any public Chart Studio graph by appending `.png` or `.jpeg` to the end of the URL for the graph. 

For example, view the static image of <https://plot.ly/~chris/1638> at <https://plot.ly/~chris/1638.png>. 

[Chart Studio Enterprise](https://plot.ly/online_chart_maker) users can also use this method to get static images in the `.pdf`, `.svg`, and `.eps` file formats.
