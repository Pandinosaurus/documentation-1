#### Is Plotly.py Free?

**Yes.** &nbsp; Plotly.py is free and open-source software, [licensed under the **MIT license**](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

#### Can I use Plotly.py without signing up to any service?

&nbsp;  &nbsp; **Yes.** &nbsp; You can use Plotly.py to render charts and maps without registering for any service,
obtaining any token, or creating any account. The one exception is that to render tile maps
which use tiles from the Mapbox service (which is optional), you will need to have a Mapbox token.

#### Can I use Plotly.py without being connected to the internet?

&nbsp;  &nbsp; **Yes.** &nbsp; You can use Plotly.py to render graphics totally offline. The one exception is that to render tile maps
which use tiles from a cloud-hosted service, such as Open Street Maps or Mapbox, you will need a connection to that service. You can render tile maps totally offline if you run your local own tile server, however.
